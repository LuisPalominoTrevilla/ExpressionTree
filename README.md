# ExpressionTree
Builds an expression tree with a given algebraic expression.
Uses a stack in order to create the binary tree obeying operator precedence.
While traversing the tree inorder, you get the infix of the expression.
While traversing the tree postorder, you get the posfix of the expression.
Once the tree has the expression, it can be evaluated.
For now, this tree does not allow the expresion to have a variable or parenthesis.
The only acceptable operators are -+*/^
The expression must be a valid one
